# Our Mission

Our mission is to eliminate traffic deaths and improve the quality of life in Halton Region by enabling residents to safely and comfortably use sustainable and active modes of transportation.

## Our raison d'être

Safe Streets Halton was created out of the desire for all road users to travel safely. Inspired by the success stories of cities that have eliminated traffic-related deaths and serious injuries (i.e. accomplished Vision Zero), we believe that Halton Region is capable of the same transformation. In order for us to reach that goal, a collective voice is needed.

# How we work

We act as a group where safe streets and active transportation advocates can collaborate. We commit to being a resource for the public in educating on Vision-Zero strategies. When called upon, we will use our voice as a collective to demand and guide change.

# Our Vision

A region with zero traffic deaths and serious injuries. A region where walking and cycling are not only a safe option, but a compelling way of getting around. Kids playing in the streets, neighbours and friends having chance encounters, improved health and cleaner air – it’s not a pipe dream.
