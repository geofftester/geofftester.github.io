# Provincial Party Platform Rankings

![graphic showing ranking of each political platform for each section (walking and land use, transit, cycling, roads and road safety)](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/624d1887e70f262c57482b3a/549fde11-fb33-4fb7-a736-53f0065634f4/Ontario2022PlatformReview.png)

Present-day suburbs were built with the car in mind. Our land use patterns have historically been built on the assumption that we can, and will, drive to our destinations. This is unsustainable from an environmental standpoint, and has negatively impacted the safety of the streets for everyone, whether they walk, cycle, or drive. Halton Region can drastically benefit from a Provincial government that understands Vision Zero concepts and provides solutions to improve the ways we get around.

We reviewed the party platforms and ranked each platform based on four factors that influence street design and safety:

- Walkability/Land Use Policy
    
- Transit
    
- Cycling
    
- Roads & Road Safety
    

_*The progressive conservative party did not release a formal platform and its 2022 budget was referred to instead. The lack of a platform made it difficult to judge the PC party, and this is a running theme throughout this review. Previous announcements made by the party may not have been factored into the rankings._


## Walking and

## Land Use

Land use has a direct impact on how we get around. Halton Region is a prime example of suburban sprawl; with single detached homes, wide roads and excessive parking, there are very few amenities nearby and residents are more likely to drive to get to their destination. If they choose to walk, cycle, or take transit, the experience is unpleasant and unsafe.

> We need a Provincial government that will make real changes to improve how we handle future growth.

Supporting more missing middle housing can increase density in our established neighbourhoods, instead of continuing to sprawl outward. Removing exclusionary zoning makes it easier to build multi-family homes.

More density focused on transit routes will make it easier for residents to consider taking transit. An increase in transit demand can also help improve service levels to continue to make transit more attractive.

Removing parking minimums is a game-changer. Current parking minimums are outdated and have resulted in vast paved areas taking up space in desirable neighbourhoods. If we lower parking requirements for developments, our neighbourhoods will have more space for housing, local businesses, parks and other amenities.

Changes to land use policy allow us to build more housing without the need for tall towers. Linking land use to transit allows people more options to get around. Put everything together, the future of Halton Region is one where a personal vehicle is an option but not the only option. When more people are walking, cycling and taking transit, it means we’ve succeeded in creating a safe environment for them to choose these options.

### What we looked for

- Ending urban sprawl
    
- Density near transit
    
- Removal of red-tape to creating housing of a walkable form
    
- Connection to pedestrian facilities and green space for a more pleasant experience for those outside of a car.
    
- Removal of Parking Minimums
    

### Where do the parties stand?

#### First place: Green Party

The Green Party platform demonstrates a clear vision to change land use and encourage more dense developments in the future. The level of detail in their plan indicates an understanding of the current issues and provides steps to resolve them. Points we noted from the platform include:

- Prezone for missing middle and mid-rise on transit corridors and main streets. This will help get projects moving faster and reduce building costs.
    

- Require minimum densities along transit corridors as part of the Growth Plan and transit funding agreements between the province and municipalities.
    
- Require that intensification targets are met with distributed density throughout urbanized areas.
    
- Add protected walking paths, trails, or multi-modal facilities for pedestrians, and enhance with green space where possible.
    
- Removal of minimum parking requirements
    

#### Second Place: Liberal Party

The Liberal Party checks many of the same boxes, putting it in a close second. Points we noted from the platform include:

- More urban intensification to prevent sprawl
    
- Allow homes with up to 3 units and two storeys to be built as of right, and extend permissions to secondary and laneway suites
    
- Encourage low-rise multiplexes and other mid rise housing near transit.
    
- Introduction of parking maximums around rapid transit stations
    

#### Third Place: New Democratic Party

The NDP mentioned ending sprawl in their platform, but did not provide any details beyond this within their full platform. After releasing their platform, the NDP did release a housing plan that included the following points:

- Removal of exclusionary zoning
    
- Encourage more basement apartments, laneway houses, and granny flats
    
- Removal of minimum parking requirements
    

#### Fourth Place: Progressive Conservative Party

The PC Party mentioned starting a study to possibly implement some of the recommendations from the [ontario housing task force report](https://files.ontario.ca/mmah-housing-affordability-task-force-report-en-2022-02-07-v2.pdf).

## Transit

Taking transit is a shared experience. It removes us from our personal vehicles and gets us interacting with our community. Every transit rider is one less car on the road and the more people who take transit, the more likely we are to invest in safer infrastructure for transit rides, pedestrians and cyclists. For many in Halton Region, transit is inconvenient and a last resort. Halton Region can benefit drastically from more connections to our neighbouring municipalities and improvements to GO Transit.

> We need a Provincial government that will fund transit service improvements make it a more appealing option for day-to-day travel.

### What we looked for

- Transit Investments
    
- Incentives for people to use transit
    
- Expanded transit services connecting all of Halton Region
    
- Inter-regional/inter-city transit investments
    
- Improved reliability and frequency of transit
    

### Where do the parties stand?

#### First Place: Liberal Party

The Liberal Party platform has short-term plans to improve transit affordability, balanced fares when traveling across municipal boundaries (in the GTA), and increased funding. What really pushed them into first place were the following points:

- Improved inter-city connections
    
- 2-way all-day GO Train service on the Milton line
    

#### Second Place: Green Party

An extremely close second, the Green Party wants to triple public transit trips by 2030 by improving transit affordability, speed, and reliability. However, they provide fewer details than the Liberal Party. They also mention the following:

- Triple Dedicated bus lanes by 2025
    
- Prioritize public transit in all transportation making decisions
    
- 2-way all-day GO Train service across the system'
    

#### Third Place: New Democratic Party

The NDP platform mentions funding 50% of transit operating costs and restoring train service in Northern Ontario. Otherwise, there was very little that we thought would directly affect Halton Region. A few other points they made are:

- Fare Integration
    
- Year-round service to Bowmanville, Grimsby, and Niagara
    

#### Fourth Place: Progressive Conservatives



## Cycling

Halton Region has an avid cycling community, yet there is little to no infrastructure throughout the region to keep these cyclists safe. With protected bike lanes only starting to enter the conversation in Halton, and residents beginning to recognize it as a legitimate form of transportation, we need all the help we can get to build a network of safe infrastructure.

> We need a provincial government will recognize and invest in cycling as a healthy and legitimate form of transportation for people of **all** ages and abilities.

### What we looked for

- Investment in safety and expansion of cycling networks
    
- E-bike rebates
    
- Acknowledgment of accessibility for all ages and abilities.
    

### Where do the parties stand?

#### First Place: Green Party

Incentives from the Green Party for e-bikes, bike share, and adaptive bikes and trikes will increase access for many who currently may face barriers to cycling.  Their platform is again very detailed and well-researched, indicating they understand the issues and have well thought-out solutions to fix them. They also have plans to:

-  Direct municipalities to build protected bike lanes, and provide funding for these projects. 
    
- Consider accessibility features to ensure projects work for everyone.  
    
- Mandate secure bike parking and prioritizing road maintenance (i.e. snow clearing) for sidewalks, bike lanes and transit lanes.
    

#### Second Place: Liberal Party

The liberal party also offers e-bike incentives, and a fund of $100 million per year for communities to build safe cycling infrastructure. While evaluating the platform, it was noted that $100 million a year would not be nearly enough for the amount of work we have ahead of us as a Region and a Province.

#### Third Place Tie: Progressive Conservatives Party & New Democratic Party

## Roads and

## Road Safety

Vision Zero (zero traffic-related deaths and injuries) is at the forefront of why Safe Streets Halton exists. Safe streets starts with road design; if we design roads with safety in mind for all users at the start, we can be more proactive in protecting vulnerable road users instead of the more reactive status quo that allows drivers to speed, and relies on police enforcement to maintain safety.

> We need a provincial government that will put the safety and well-being of **all** road users first.

### What we looked for

- Investments in municipal road infrastructure
    
- Mentions of Vision Zero or Vision Zero ideologies
    
- Street design standards and improvements
    
- Slower speeds on municipal highways
    
- Vehicle speed, dimensions, and weight regulation
    

### Where do the parties stand?

#### First Place: Green Party

The Green Party explicitly mentions Vision Zero in their platform. Again, they include details on how to achieve this, showing their understanding of the issue. A few points they made are:

- Using street design to reduce speeds in areas where pedestrians and cyclists are most vulnerable
    
- Enforce bike lanes, to prevent drivers from forcing cyclists into dangerous traffic
    
- By 2023 all heavy vehicles must have a speed governor so they comply with applicable speed limits. 
    
- Pay for dedicated truck lane on the 407 instead of building highway 413.
    

#### Second Place: Liberal Party

The Liberal Party mentions a goal of achieving zero fatalities or serous road injuries. Though in less detail than the Green Party, the Liberal Party does mention road design changes. However, further 400-series highway widening is proposed (specifically the 401 in Mississauga). The points we noted are:

- Support road design that improves safety and reduces collisions
    
- Increase penalties for driving offences that result in fatalities or serious injuries
    
- Scrap Highway 413
    

#### Third Place: New Democratic Party

The NDP make no mentions of street/road safety in their platform. They do mention widening of highways, such as the expansion of highway 7 between Kitchener and Guelph. They also pledge to stop highway 413.

#### Fourth Place: Progressive Conservative Party

The PC Party have promised to build the highway 413, lower gas taxes, and get rid of paying for license stickers; all which run against encouraging active transportation and improving road safety.

## Wrapping it up

The Green Party is the highest-ranked overall due to the details of their plans, and understanding of the issues at hand regarding transportation and transportation safety. In the coming months, we hope to see a stronger focus on street safety and transportation from our municipal candidates, and we will push to bring more attention to this important issue for the next provincial election.
