# Talking to Council, Information and Tips

Safe Streets Halton encourages you to come forward and have your voice heard between elections. Some ways to do this are:

- **Direct communication with your elected representatives**
- **Participating in Council meetings**
- **Petitions**

## Direct communication

Through direct communication, you would email or phone the office of your representative. You can inform your representative of your opinion on a topic, request information, or ask to set up a time to speak about a specific issue. Depending on the information request, staff may be able to provide details.

## Council Meetings

Each month (with exceptions in summer), councils meet to discuss important items, this can range from land-use to transportation policies. These meetings are typically streamed live to the municipality’s website or YouTube. There are two ways to participate in local and regional council meetings. 

1. **Written Correspondence**  
    This is essentially a letter added to the public record stating your opinion on the matter being discussed. Written correspondence is a good way to participate when you are strapped for time.
    
2. **Delegations**  
    Making a presentation to the council about the specific item, either virtually or in-person. You can use slides if you choose. Each municipality has different rules, though typically you are limited to 5-10 minutes, and need to register to delegate by 12PM the day before. Some councils allow “walk-on” delegations, so you can show up then register to speak during the item. See the links at the bottom of the page for information related to your municipality.
    

### Delegation Process

After registering, during the meeting you will be called up to speak by the “Chair” of the meeting (the person running it, most often the mayor). Depending on your town, your time to delegate could be at the start of the meeting or when the item itself is being discussed by council. Again, see the links at the bottom for information about your council. 

After you’ve finished giving your delegation, council has the opportunity to ask you questions, so wait for the chair to dismiss you.

### Delegation Tips

We know that presenting can be difficult, especially if it's your first time. Here are a few tips:

- Introduce yourself quickly and move on(usually one or two sentences is enough).
    
- Avoid tangents and diving into unnecessary details.
    
- Have a few main points that council should walk away with
    
- If it’s information heavy you can:
    

- Use slides to help organize your presentation
    
- Submit a written version with higher details, and have your delegation touch the main points
    

- Don't be afraid to say you don't know, there's no expectation for you to be a subject matter expert (unless you state that you are)
    
- If you feel any sort of intimidation during your deputation, tell the chair
    
- Address the chair of the meeting as Chair, and if it's the mayor you say "Mayor". 
    
- You don't have to answer questions if you don't want to
    
- Typically, councillors can **ONLY** ask questions of delegates. If they make a statement, you can take it as an opportunity to reply. If you're challenged, mention the rules of procedure. Use that as you will (sometimes they'll just say they agree and thank you)
    
- Have written notes to help you, and don’t worry about reading from the paper
    

## Petitions

A petition is a collection of names and addresses that show fellow residents desire, support, or opposition for something. Each municipality has different rules for petitions, with some allowing online petitions to be submitted such as from “Change.org”. Often you’ll need a sitting member of council to sponsor your petition during a meeting. More info in the links below.
